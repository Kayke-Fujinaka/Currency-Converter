## :page_facing_up: Explanation

The application is a currency converter. It converts from real to 11 different currencies, namely: US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Swiss Franc, Danish Krone, South African Rand, Japanese Yen, South Korean Won and Bitcoin.

<b>How to use?</b>

To use it, you need to put a value in the input that says "R$ 10,000.00". Then you just need to press the button and see the converted value.

In addition, the project makes it possible to exchange the amount converted into other currencies. To select just click on select and you will have 11 currency options and just choose one of them. By clicking on the formatting, conversion, name and image that is at the bottom of the project will change according to the selected currency.

<b>Information!</b>

The value of 1 currency for real until the day (08/04/2022 15:27) in which this application was made:

US dollar = Real-time conversion<br>
Canadian dollar = 3.76<br>
Australian dollar = 3.53<br>
Euro = Real-time conversion<br>
Pound Sterling = 6.17<br>
Swiss franc = 5.06<br>

Currencies are formatted according to your country.

For example: We have R$ 1000 reais converted into won will be approximately 256 thousand won, that is, this formatted money will be ‚Ç©256,410 and not ‚Ç©256,410 as is the formatting of Brazil and other countries in the world.
